Final Project Proposal: Moon Phases through Unity and JSON, using NASA API

1. My project would be designed to carefully map moon phases to a single game object, being earth. These will change based
on the time frames as well as dates. This would realistically capture the moon phases throughout time and showcase them through an earth and moon model which can change with updated time. I would further want to explore using textures to create a real representation
of space in a unity scene.

2. This project would consist of various game objects and would implement the data of the moon phases dates and times and where to be placed based on scripts, JSON implementation, and scene.

3. I know a few scripts that can implement movement of earth's and moon's rotation and other scripts that can mimic basic functionalities of these components. I also wanted to make earth as realisitic as possible with textures and lighting.

  I do not know how to implement to fullness of the current API that I want to use and will continue to research and break down the
  aspects of this API to understand how I can use it within the scene and scripts. 
  
4. The real-time data I am using is through NASA's website that carries a variety of API's which I have chosen to be NASA Moon Phases which will showcase in real time the different moon phases during different times of the year on Earth. I wanted to use
real-time data related to space as I find the concept of anything outside of earth's bounds fascinating.

5.  http://www.wdisseny.com/lluna/?lang=en ---> This is the api I am using, and have tested it to make sure it is capable of relaying 
current real-time data, as I have a API Key and can alter the perimeters to change the data initially.
