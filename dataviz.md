Final Project Proposal: Asteroids near Earth through Unity and JSON, using NASA API

1. My project would be designed to carefully map the location of asteroids to a single game object, being earth. These will change based
on the time frames as well as dates. This would realistically capture the movement of asteroids and other objects orbiting the earth
and how their movement can change with updated time. I would further want to explore using textures to create a real representation
of space in a unity scene.

2. This project would consist of various game objects and would implement the data of the asteroid locations and where to be placed
based on scripts, JSON implementation, and scene.

3. I know a few scripts that can implement the movement of these asteroids such as spawning, rotation, and other scripts to mimic
basic moving functionalities. I would also implement 'Earth's' game object to be realistic with it's own movement of rotation and 
display of texture. 

  I do not know how to implement to fullness of the current API that I want to use and will continue to research and break down the
  aspects of this API to understand how I can use it within the scene and scripts. 
  
4. The real-time data I am using is through NASA's website that carries a variety of API's which I have chosen to be Asteroids-NeoWs
(Near Earth Object Web Service) which will showcase in real time the location of each asteroid object near Earth. I wanted to use
real-time data related to space as I find the concept of anything outside of earth's bounds fascinating.

5. https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod ---> This is the api I am using, and have tested it to make sure it is capable of relaying 
current real-time data, as I have a API Key and can alter the perimeters to change the data initially. 

The demo api to showcase the feedback is listed below:
