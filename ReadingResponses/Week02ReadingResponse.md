<b> Week 02: Reading Response </b>

Art has evolved dramatically throughout the years, as this including using Litographcs, tracing, and other methods
to create techniques within the art realm. As stated, "Mechanical reproduction of a work of art, however, represents
something new..." New, meaning that artists can create anything, especially outside of the traditional elements
of design-- eventually expanding to new horizons of creation. This applies to digital games as many styles of art
have evolved from basic means to now advanced and detailed elements within different games. I believe that this
truly encaptures the concept of apply to digital games because as traditional art work was used on wood, which
then shifted towards stone -- now digital games are created through computers, tablets, and even through old fashioned
sketches.

Digital games don't just contain art, they evolved these styles to create interests for all gamers. As some styles
can engulf the user in mysteries, others may engulf through fantasy. All these concepts of art evolution have heavily
applied to digital games. It has shown that through technology we have no forgotten our roots of originality, but we
have only grown from them and made them our own.
