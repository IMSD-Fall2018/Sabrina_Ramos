Reading Response for Week 01:

I believe the game 'The Founder' by Francis Tseng is about the realism of starting/running a business as well as using various 
components to ensure the business remains successful. As there are many concepts in the game that tie to the real life processes of
creating a business. These concepts are rather easy for gamers to understand and they make the experience engaging for all users. 
While further playing the game, I began to understand that a business has different sections that need managing, such as employees,
products, perks, and using the market to build on shares. This game truly encaptures what it means to be a business owner; as well
as experimenting with new employees and building products that can continue to help the company expand. 

The reason I believe the game is a stepping stone for people to understand businesses point of views, is because of how the built of 
the game is for the user. It breaks down all important factors into categories that the player can experiment with and expand on. As a
player who has rarely any business experience, it is interesting to understand more of how businesses in the real world may thrive
using the schematic that this game follows. Within the game the player is given options on how they choose to run their business, 
which in the long run can impact the player's experience with their business (which includes location and cofounders). The realistic
components of this game alter the experience for all players and can match towards a player's gaming style.
